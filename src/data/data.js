    description: "Tender chicken in a spicy, tangy sauce, garnished with fresh herbs and sesame seeds.",
    details: "Sze Chuan Chicken in Chili Oil (口水鸡), often translated as \"Mouthwatering Chicken,\" is a beloved dish from Sichuan cuisine that perfectly showcases the region's signature flavors. The dish features tender, poached chicken bathed in a vibrant, aromatic chili oil sauce. The sauce is infused with the signature heat of Sichuan peppercorns, offering a delightful numbing spiciness balanced with tangy vinegar and savory seasonings. Garnished with fresh herbs, sesame seeds, and often a sprinkle of crushed peanuts, this dish is a feast for the senses, boasting bold, authentic flavors and an enticing aroma. \nWhat sets Sze Chuan Chicken in Chili Oil apart is its unique serving style and refreshing character. Unlike many spicy dishes served hot, Sze Chuan Chicken in Chili Oil is served cold, offering a contrast that highlights the complexity of its flavors. Each bite delivers a harmonious blend of textures—from the smoothness of the chicken to the slight crunch of the garnishes—and a lingering, mouthwatering sensation from the chili oil. This dish is a quintessential example of Sichuan cuisine’s mastery in combining heat, flavor, and aroma into an unforgettable culinary experience.",
